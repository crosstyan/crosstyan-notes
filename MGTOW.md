# Man Go Their Own Way

I'm male and I have biases.

## Black Pill

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel#Red_pill

> In manosphere communities such as men's rights groups and, according to some
researchers, in incel communities as well, "taking the red pill" means seeing a
world where feminism has given women too much power over men and male privilege
does not exist.

> The "black pill" generally refers to a set of commonly held beliefs in incel
communities, which include biological determinism, fatalism, and defeatism for
unattractive people.

> An incel who has "taken the black pill" has adopted the belief that they are
hopeless, and that their lack of success romantically and sexually is permanent
regardless of any changes they might try to make to their physical appearance,
personality, or other characteristics.

> the belief in "hypergamy", or that women will abandon a man if they are
presented with the opportunity to have sex with or enter into a relationship
with a more attractive man.

This description is controversial. Well, you have to get the exact meaning of
Red Pill and Black Pill from context.

> Redpilled incels believe they have the opportunity to fight back against this
system which disadvantages them, which they do by trying to make themselves more
attractive to women. Conversely, blackpilled incels are those who believe they
can do nothing to change their situation.

- https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Blackpill

> The Blackpill ideology claims that physical attractiveness is the primary
determining factor in dating and relationship success. Unlike the Bluebill and
Redpill ideologies, Blackpill maintains that the effects that physical
appearance has on one’s performance and results in the dating world cannot be
remedied by improving personality, clothing, hairstyle or hygiene. Any
non-physical characteristics, such as personality, will simply be shadowed by
one's physical appearance which include facial proportionality, height, body fat
percentage and frame. The theory also holds that women generally want to 'date
up' and tend to look for men who are higher than them in status and
attractiveness which leaves average men with even less options.

> In reality, Blackpill is entirely descriptive and makes no prescriptions as to
what someone ought to feel about this realization. That is up to the individual.
Secondly, one need not necessarily be an Incel to be blackpilled.

- https://www.newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/misogynist-incels-and-male-supremacism/red-pill-to-black-pill/

> This belief system accepts the Red Pill view of society dominated by women but
rejects individual-level attempts such as learning game to achieve a sexual
relationship with women as misguided, asserting that only change at a societal
level has the possibility to be effective. Black Pill adherents believe that
looks are genetically determined, and that women choose sexual partners based
solely on physical features (“lookism”), so whether or not a person will be an
incel is predetermined.

> Misogynist incels attempt to prove the truth of the Black Pill through
misreadings of scientific studies, online dating datasets, and their own
"experiments" to prove that women only care about a man’s physical looks.
Although some incels still seek out plastic surgery, work out ("gym maxxing"),
or try to otherwise improve their physical features, many believe such
strategies are pointless as inceldom is a problem with society, not the
individual. Blackpilled incels are aware of appearance and sociability/game
strategies and reject them as solutions.

> incel男实际上是渴女，渴女引发了仇女和杀女。
然而 女权把incel和mgtow混杂在一起才是对mgtow的污蔑，她们想造谣每个mgtow都是潜在的杀女分子，把不想供养女性的男性污名化。她们最反对男性的“不渴女”思想

> 小说中的女性形象对女人进行了粉饰和美化，因为所有小说中的男主角全都是一穷二白的形象，这种状态恰恰是一个男人一生中绝大多数时候的状态。这种一穷二白一无所有的状态，最容易让男人产生代入感。在小说之中，这种一穷二白一无所有的男人，总是有一个十分温柔十分善良的女人，始终陪伴在他身边，鼓励着他成长，伴随着他成长，促使着他成长。但请你特别注意一点，这是小说而不是现实。

> 女人喜欢成熟的男人，只不过是拜金的粉饰，但是直接说拜金会显得让人厌恶，于是加上喜欢成熟的男人，这一层语言腐败来粉饰。

Here is what I agree in ideal situation. Well that's easy.

> 至于怎么破除男本位女本位，很简单，两个人只想一起沟通交流，达成相对理解，然后尽量杜绝自私心理，一起为家庭未来着想，夫妻不想吵架的最好方法就是考虑孩子的未来，理解孩子的心理。

怎么听怎么空洞.

> The very reason why the MGTOW movement exists in the first place is that women have outpriced themselves.

> Men are not stupid. They are creative, intelligent, rational, practical,
clever and social, and men thrive in their own social circles - games, sports,
hobbies, arts, interests, you name it. Once you remove sex from the equation,
there are actually few needs for a woman to most men, if the man in question has
good male friends.

> Romance is maybe not yet totally dead, but its forthcoming death is signalled
by object-gadgets which promise to deliver excessive pleasure but which
effectively reproduce only the lack itself. <br>
The latest fashion is the Stamina Training Unit, a counterpart to the vibrator:
a masturbatory device that resembles a battery-powered light (so we’re not
embarrassed when carrying it around). You put the erect penis into the opening
at the top, push the button, and the object vibrates till satisfaction... The
product is available in different colours, levels of tightness and forms (hairy
or without hair, etc) that imitate all three main openings for sexual
penetration (mouth, vagina, anus). What one buys here is the partial object
(erogenous zone) alone, deprived of the embarrassing additional burden of the
entire person. <br>
How are we to cope with this brave new world which undermines the basic premises
of our intimate life? The ultimate solution would be, of course, to push a
vibrator into the Stamina Training Unit, turn them both on and leave all the fun
to this ideal couple, with us, the two real human partners, sitting at a nearby
table, drinking tea and calmly enjoying the fact that, without great effort, we
have fulfilled our duty to enjoy.

> 统治者变成犬儒，因为他们早就不相信他们口头上宣讲的那套理论和原则，他们只把那些理论和原则当做维护权力的手段以及镇压反抗的借口。在被统治者方面，当他们一旦意识到自己在冠冕堂皇的旗帜下实际上处于被愚弄被压迫的境地，很容易转而对一切美好的价值失去信心。尤其是在试图反抗又遭到严重的挫折之后。这样，他们就可能放弃理想，放弃追求，甚至反过来嘲笑理想，嘲笑追求——吃不着葡萄就说葡萄酸。这样，他们就变成了犬儒。当然，统治者的犬儒主义和被统治者的犬儒主义是有所不同的，但是广义地讲，它们都可以归入犬儒主义。

> Over the past year or so, I've learned that women and men are completely
different creatures. A woman will never love a man in the way that he wants to
be loved, because women and men have completely different ideas of what love is.
I actually really wish I was gay, because I think my love life would be more
satisfying. Now, I guess I haven't given up hope that someday I'll find the kind
of woman that I want, but until then (and that day may never come) I'm happy
just living my life the way I want to. All I really want is a pretty girl to be
my fuck buddy, and I'll be set.

> MGTOW = male feminists <br>
just a bunch of hurt, lonely, emotionally unstable people pretending to be empowered

> on the one hand it could be genuinely liberating to refuse the marriage industrial complex and being manipulated by the puss. <br>
on the other hand, mgtow might just be a convenient way to get you to
"voluntarily" give up something you weren't getting anyway instead of asking
hard questions about why society is failing you so miserably

> I'm actually embracing it more and more each day, and it's paying off. I don't
have to deal with the drama and bullshit other men who are in relationships do,
and when I make some serious cash, I can invest it in my hobbies, interests, and
hard-savings (like gold and silver). Just bought my first silver bar today, in
fact, for the same price it would have cost me to treat a woman to a nice
dinner. I love the MGTOW movement, because it makes me feel less 'bad' about
being single, and assures what I've known for so long but was afraid to say:
women are nothing but cold, manipulative bitches.

> The modern women can no longer cook, they no longer want children and they are
no longer warm, tidy and loving creatures who think spending time with their
family is a good thing. They are probably too "independent" "strong" to even
have a family of their own. The only thing modern women have to offer men today
is sex. So instead of being loving housewives who cook and raise children, they
are reduced to being sexual objects only and they are so messed up emotionally
and intellectually that they often spend most of the money the make on their
jobs on plastic surgery, cosmetics and tons of clothes they think will make them
look good, in a desperate attempt to stay or become more attractive. Well,
they have no other qualities attractive to men, so what else can we expect?
This is the fruit of feminism. The fruit of "women's liberation".

> MGTOW is an excellent example of natural selection. It makes life easier for
all of us when the not so well adapted voluntarily remove themselves from the
gene pool.

> Natural selection works on the genetic level and there's no link between MGTOW
and genetics, there's only a link between MGTOW and society.
Look at the grass eating men in Japan, they're like MGTOW but the trend has been
going on longer there and the percentage of the population not interested in LTR
(Long Term Relationship) with women is massive. Yet the numbers of them rise as
births drop, because it's caused be problems in society and not by genetic
lines. [Post No.682811557](https://4chanarchives.com/board/b/thread/682794270#p682811557)

> Over time the weaker genes that make one less well adapted to society and more
susceptible to this movement will be eliminated.

> But there is no evidence that some genes are more susceptible to MGTOW
behaviour, if you look at the MGTOW men there is a huge amount of diversity in
practically everything, how good looking you are, how intelligent,
introverted/extroverted, there's every type of man.
It's basically just trolling to say that all MGTOW are one type of person, yes
we know very clever, make broad assumptions and all the rest of it, but if you
want serious discussion on the matter then you need to look at how diverse MGTOW
are to know it has nothing to do with genetics.
It's entirely socially based, at one point there were no MGTOW because society
didn't punish men like it does now, hence MGTOW is a reactionary phenomena and
as such there's no discrimination for what men are targeted, doesn't matter if
you're smart or rich or living under a bridge, women shit on all men and all men
are potentially MGTOW.

> I don't want to go my own way. I want a woman, all the good and bad things.
I'm tired of being alone but I don't have anything to offer anyone. I'm not
handsome, successful, or well endowed. I think I'm doing women a favor by not
approaching them or giving them false hopes that would only end up with them
being disappointed

> real MGTOW dont push it like a door to door salemen, but just live.

> MGTOW generally aren't men that "gave up" but rather decided the juice isn't
worth the squeeze. If the game is rigged against you then the only winning more
is to not play.
