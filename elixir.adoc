### Pipe

The |> operator takes the result of the expression to its left and inserts it as
the first parameter of the function invocation to its right. 

### Ampersand (`&`) Notation

```elixir
add_one = &(&1 + 1)
```

```scala
var add_one = (_:Int) + 1
```

There’s a second form of the & function capture operator. You can give it the
name and arity (number of parameters) of an existing function, and it will
return an anonymous function that calls it. 

```elixir
&(IO.puts(&1)) = &IO.puts/1
```

*its number of parameters (its arity)*

In Elixir a named function is identified by both its name and its number of
parameters (its arity). 

These two functions are totally separate as far
as Elixir is concerned. But from a human perspective, you’d imagine that if
two functions have the same name they are somehow related, even if they
have a different number of parameters.


### Pattern Matching

When you call a named function, Elixir tries to match your arguments with
the parameter list of the first definition (clause). If it cannot match them, it
tries the next definition of the same function (remember, this must have the
same arity) and checks to see if it matches. It continues until it runs out of
candidates.

```elixir
  # for some reason, elixir needs a comma before do
  @spec whichbuzz(integer, integer, integer) :: String.t | integer
  def whichbuzz(0, 0, _), do: "FizzBuzz"
  def whichbuzz(0, _, _), do: "Fizz"
  def whichbuzz(_, 0, _), do: "Buzz"
  def whichbuzz(_, _, n), do: n
  def fizzbuzz n do
    whichbuzz(rem(n,3), rem(n,5), n)
  end
```

### Default Param

When you define a named function, you can give a default value to any of its
parameters by using the syntax param `\\` value.
