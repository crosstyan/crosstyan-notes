# Self-Harm

## Research

- Self-injurious behavior is often known as self-harm, self-mutilation, or cutting.
- Childhood adversity refers to difficult and unpleasant situations and experiences in childhood, including physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect and poverty

The most common reasons why adolescents participate in self-injury is; as a coping mechanism, a means of relief, for the regulation of feelings, self-punishment, attention seeking and sensation seeking.

There is often a link between depressive symptoms and negative life events or past trauma.

When educators are able understand a student’s past traumas as well as be able to identify possible triggers for a student, they can avoid events and circumstances than may lead to an emotional and negative response. Avoiding an emotional and negative response may lead to a reduction in self-harming incidents.

there needs to be an understanding of trauma and depression. adolescence is a developmental transition in which changes in rates of depression and stress are likely to occur

Depressive symptoms may preclude self-injury, therefor it is important for educators to understand that link.

## How to help someone self-harming

- Don't apologize, don't ask what you did wrong. Self harm isn't something people do to others. If you apologize, she might feel guilty and might feel like an impostor, like "am I hurting myself just to get to him?"
- You can discuss whatever triggered this crisis later, when she feels safer and more stable.
- Ask her what you can do to help. If she says she needs space, believe her; if you're worried she only wants to be alone to hurt herself even more, there are ways for you to make yourself "invisible" and keep her silent company.
- Remind her to treat her wounds. This is a big one which lots of self harmers overlook. Her cuts might get infected and then they'll hurt even more later on. If she feels comfortable with it, you can tend to her wounds yourself
- Don't let her promise to stop. She likely won't be able to stop herself from cutting just because she said she would;because now she feels guilty for breaking her promise, which can lead to more cutting, and more guilt, and so on.
- **"I'm with you because of you, not because of your disease; you're not your disease"** DO NOT feel like you owe her a relationship just because she deals with self harming. My biggest fear used to be that my boyfriend only kept seeing me because he was afraid I would hurt myself if he left.
- Trying to associate her stability to you or to your relationship will be poisonous for everyone involved. Support her while she gets the professional care she needs, ask her what she and her therapist think are the best ways you can help.

> You shouldn't be the one responsible to shoulder her mental problems and provide her stability.

> She isn't ready to be in a relationship.

> Make sure you’re getting the mental health support **you** need - “put on your own oxygen mask before helping others around you.”

- move on;
- tell her parents/support network you are leaving her and ask them to look out for her; and
- if she has any medical carers, if she is at risk then consider alerting them too

> Please don't take on the burden of curing her and make sure you take care of yourself.

## 自残的动机

自残是一种故意破坏自己身体组织的举动，但本质上.它并非像自杀一样.要让自己死去。在求诊精神科的自残族群中70%割伤自己的皮肤.可能是手掌, 手腕、手臂或大腿等等.其他常见的方式包括撞头、捶手，香烟烫、绝食等等. 自残行为是生理、心理、社会三方面复杂作用之下产生的最终结果。
当看到家人、朋友出现自残行为.首先耍问：是什么样的动机造成的？国际精神医学界将自残行为大致归纳为七种动机

### 调节情绪

这是自残者最想达到的一种效果,
当个人有太多负面情绪，包括对外界愤怒、强烈的焦虑或挫折感.就可能把自残当成应对压力的方式。特别是求学的育少年和儿童，因表达、处理情绪能力还未发展成熟，常用自残行为来减轻负面情绪，家长和教师应多注意。

### 自我惩罚

对自己较无自信，或容易自责的人，会用自残来表达对自己的愤怒，以及惩罚自己的不是之姓。如果父母给予孩子过度要求与批评，可能会在孩子心中种下一个过度严苛,让孩子变得自卑，未来遭遇挫折或表现达不到父毋要求时，容易用自我来惩用自己。

### 影晌人际

自残者身边不乏有关切他的家人、朋友或教师.但自残者每每让关切者感到疲累.挫败，甚至让人不想理会.因为他惯以自残行为操弄他人或吸引他人的关心.其至控制身边重要的人。

### 标榜独立

当对方要自己做不想做的事，例如亲密伴倡要求分手、老板要妙自己耽鱼，这时出现的自残行为是为了表达独立自主.显示只有自己能掌控自己，对方是不可能控制他的.

### 抵抗解离

解离状态是当人面临很大的心理压力时会让自己变得麻木，希望能忽视痛苦。但麻木也让人失去活着的感觉，因此借着自残.让自己感觉痛楚.重新取得活着的感觉。

### 抵抗自杀

乍听吊诡.其实也合理。当负面情堵累积到一定程度，自残者可能考虑自杀；在尝试自杀前.如果以自残来减轻某部分负面情绪，就可能远高自杀。因此，自度或许是自杀的保护因子.提醒自己或他人，的确有心理困扰，必须积极面对与处理。

### 追求刺激

人体受伤时.脑部同时分泌“脑内啡”.让人产生欣快的感觉，将痛苦驱除“有时候，自残也会引发像坐云筲飞车或高空弹跳的快感，青少年集体公开割腕,常常是用这种白残行为，一同迫求快感,并借以建立同伴认同。

伤害身体会痛.但自残者常认为：伤口一点都不痛.心比较痛。这里的"心"可能就是上述七种心理原因之一。

面对自残者，其家人和亲友应将眼光从不痛的伤口.转移到会痛的心.找机会倾听自残者描述他们所而对的困境,支持他的情感与想法，陪伴他们用正向的方式解决问题“许多自残者也同时，患有抑郁症、焦虑症，或精神分裂症等等,如果自残者或关怀者遇到困难.应找精神科专业医生协助。

原版EPQ于1975年制定，它是一种自陈量表 ，有成人和少年两种形式(本量表为成人形式)，各包括4个量表

- E——内外向
- N——神经质，又称情绪性
- P——精神质 ，又称倔强 、讲求实际
- L——谎造或自身隐蔽

经艾森克等人的因素分析计算，前3个量表代表人格结构的3种维度 ，它们是彼此独立的 ，L 则是效度量表 ，代表假托的人格特质，也表现社会性朴实 、幼稚的水平 。L 虽与其他量表有某些相关 ，但它本身却代表一种稳定的人格功能 。

# Let a relationship go

[Why is it so hard to let go of someone even when you are aware that you're mutually bad for each other? : relationship_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b24mb9/why_is_it_so_hard_to_let_go_of_someone_even_when/)

Whatever you do: Don't stop loving in general. Don't close your heart, don't let this harden you. Love is good. Love is beautiful. Instead of trying to stop loving one person, try to sometimes direct that love towards your peers, pets or strangers.

True enough except 'letting go' to many means 'not caring' and that, to my novice Buddhist mind, is not what Buddhism is about. The cure Buddhism has opened my eyes to is one of discernment -- don't try to ignore the sadness or forget your feelings, rather try to understand what in your mind is causing you misery.

There is no 'master' that can just turn off these feelings, only those who have become good at understanding themselves and accepting their inner struggles.

Getting to the bottom of it, the point where this feeling comes from is wherein lies the true answer to your problems

Make a short list of the most important reasons why you wanted to break up and put it as the background image of your phone. This way you'll always have a reminder around you in case you are feeling nostalgic.

Too many people settle for what's just fine and even bad because it's comforting. It's complacent and stagnating.

Basically, don't belittle her fears. If she's paranoid about HIV, telling her she's being irrational and ridiculous isn't going to help. Instead, think of proactive steps you can encourage her to take with an eye on the future -- NOT on the past tests. Do NOT focus energy on how effective the test she took the other week, because she's already decided that must be wrong. Instead, focus on next steps, and understanding what those next steps are.

The person who is penetrated is much more at risk. This is why HIV is more common among gay men - they are the only population which contains individuals who participate in penetrating and being penetrated. They catch it when they bottom, and spread it when they top.

>Even relatively small risks can add up over time and lead to a high lifetime risk of getting HIV.  In other words, there may be a relatively small chance of acquiring HIV when engaging in a risk behavior with an infected partner only once; but, if repeated many times, the overall likelihood of becoming infected after repeated exposures is actually much higher.

> 不过，如果真的有人“刻意学习抑郁”到了伤害自己身心的地步， 那么我们必须考虑：这个人或许存在一些其他方面的心理问题。他仍然需要及时接受心理学帮助和干预。「不管是怎样的人设，她都是想要被人关注而已。」

> 如果是真抑郁，你的同情又有什么用，他不需要这份廉价的同情，也不会因为你的一点同情而有所好转。
> 装抑郁往往是内心渴望被关注的表现，像这样的人，你能说他心理就一点问题都没有吗？他也有心理上的缺陷，也需要关怀。

> 因为中国社会用来表达负面情绪、表达个人的真实痛苦与情感的个体性的话语严重匮乏和受阻，导致人们为了回避指责，不得不借助抑郁症的框架来表达那些本属于正常人性、正常情感的东西。

> 如果像现在这样扩大范围，会不会让一些没有必要「治疗」的人被贴上「抑郁症」的标签，给他们不佳的心理暗示，甚至加重「病情」，或是承受一些治疗带来的不必要的副作用？或者可不可能，在后人看来，现在定义的一些「抑郁」症状并不是病，只是人的多样性的体现，或者是在特殊环境下造就的呢？（举一个极端的例子，在文革年代如果有现代心理医学，绝大部分知识分子都可能被定义为「抑郁症」，但这想想似乎并不合理。）

> 多重人格在影视作品中会如此受欢迎或许是因为其意象很完美的成为城市化的现代社会的隐喻，人际关系疏离，每天要面对很多很多人，每个人同时生活在好几个“圈子”之中，面对不同的人要表现出不同的样子，不能表现出自己的情绪，而多重人格这个形象正是这样的焦虑与不安的一种象征，也因此许多人喜欢笑称自己精神分裂来表达这种对自己情绪与社交不稳定的不安。

> 如果担心自己是多重人格，往往要关注的是，个体对于自我“不连贯”、身份分裂（identity splitting）、自己“失控”的感觉. 老祖宗沙利文人际关系理论，其实很大篇幅都在讲“自己内部的人际关系”，每个人的“人格”是不停变化的，是应对不同事物时产生的适应性产物，所以有**很多个人格本身是正常的**，还有内在家庭系统疗法（IFS：Internal Family Systems)这些，处理“自我”之间的关系。

- 幻想的朋友（fantasy friend）：在“孤独的儿童”来说多见，在DSM-5之中特别列出需要和分离性障碍进行鉴别。

Validity scales

- CNS (Q) Questions not answered
- Lie (L) – The Lie scale is intended to identify individuals who are deliberately trying to avoid answering the MMPI honestly and in a frank manner. The scale measures attitudes and practices that are culturally laudable, but rarely found in most people. In other words, people who make these items are often trying to make themselves look like a better person than they really are (or that anybody is). The scale contains 15 items.
- F – The F scale (the “F” does not stand for anything, although it is mistakenly sometimes referred to as the Infrequency or Frequency scale) is intended to detect **unusual or atypical ways of answering the test items**, like if a person were to **randomly fill out the test.** It taps a number of strange thoughts, peculiar experiences, feelings of isolation and alienation, and a number of unlikely or contradictory beliefs, expectations and self-descriptions.
- Back F (Fb) – The Back F scale measures the same issues as the F scale, except only during the last half of the test. The scale has 40 items.
- K – The K scale is designed to identify psychopathology in people who otherwise would have profiles within the normal range. It measures self-control, and family and interpersonal relationships, and people who score highly on this scale are often seen as being defensive. The scale contains 30 items.

If a person answers too many of the F and Fb scale items incorrectly, it will invalidate the entire test. Contrary to some descriptions of the scale, F scale items are scattered throughout the entire test up until around item 360. The scale contains 60 items.

DID确诊的标准一般有两项：

- 一、存在两个及以上人格。
- 二、各个人格之间记忆不共享！不共享！！！当然，存在共存意识的情况，但是记忆是不共享的！所以DID患者很多情况下是不知道自己患有DID的。

- The existence of two or more distinct identities (or “personality states”). The distinct identities are accompanied by changes in behavior, memory and thinking. The signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.
- **Amnesia** must occur, defined as gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information and/or traumatic events. Ongoing **gaps** in memory about everyday events, personal information and/or past traumatic events.  This criteria for DID newly recognize that **amnesia** doesn't just occur for traumatic events but, rather, everyday events, too.
- The symptoms cause significant distress or problems in social, occupational or other areas of functioning.
- The disturbance is not part of normal cultural or religious practices. This DID criterion is to eliminate diagnosis in cultures or situations where multiplicity is appropriate. An example of this is in children where an **imaginary friend** is not necessarily indicative of mental illness.
- The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (such as blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or a general medical condition (such as complex partial seizures). This characteristic of dissociative identity disorder is important as substance abuse or another medical condition is more appropriate to diagnose, when present, than DID.

> 精神分裂就是一个人丧失了辨识现实与幻想的能力，从而形成了一种思维的不连贯。

> 先明确一点，DID患者是难以意识到自己病情的。本人不知道副人格的存在，老人格不知道新人格的存在。

> 像是自己先发现了子人格，在脑中相互认识，但周围的人看不出来。这……确实很像幻想中的伙伴啊！

> 想象一个自认为身体正常的人，突然被告知有绝症，任谁都会产生不敢相信的、逃避的情绪，这才是最真实的病人。

> 因为病源是创伤事件，创伤会带给人多种多样的影响，如PTSD（创伤后应激障碍）、社交障碍、抑郁、焦虑，都会在DID患者身上各有体现，都有可能导致误诊或漏诊。即使观察到了真正的多个人格，也要判断原因、动机、功能。

Dissociative identity disorder involves a lack of connection among a person’s sense of identity, memory and consciousness. This disorder usually arises in response to physical and sexual abuse in childhood as a means of surviving mistreatment by people who should be nurturing and protecting.

Most often, if not always, DID is the direct result of severe trauma. Usually, this trauma happens in early childhood. There is only so much one person can take. If it becomes too much to handle, new coping mechanisms come into existence. One way to cope would be to dissociate.
