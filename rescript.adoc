# Rescript and TypeScript

https://rescript-lang.org/blog/bucklescript-is-rebranding[BuckleScript & Reason Rebranding]

> ReScript is not just a rebranding: it's a ReasonML which freed itself of the
yoke of the OCaml ecosystem. By doing so, it forfeited compilation to native
code and OCaml library interop, but gained a freer syntax which further
resembles JavaScript

## Start

- https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/installation[Installation]
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode[rescript-vscode]

[.line-through]##No `yarn create` command. Have to clone it.## See https://github.com/mahezsh/create-rescript-app[create-rescript-app]

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-project-template
cd rescript-project-template
yarn install
yarn build
node src/Demo.bs.js
```

Just don't use this boilerplate if you want to do something front-end stuff.

### `create-rescript-app`

```bash
npx create-rescript-app my-app
```

Default is https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rescript-app[`create-rescript-app`].

See also https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-react[rescript-lang/rescript-react]

### Vite

Forget that empty boilerplate. Use something really useful.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jihchi/vitejs-template-react-rescript
yarn install
yarn upgrade
yarn build
yarn serve
```

```bash
yarn build -w # enable watch
npx vite dev # development
```

modify `package.json` to add `dev` command. (no idea why it's not added by default)

#### Another Way?

Add Rescript to existing project?

## Fetch

## Typescript?

As a man of culture, be pragmatical.

Why not just write TypeScript with https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts[fp-ts], https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide[lodash-fp], https://github.com/immerjs/immer[immer] and https://ramdajs.com/[ramdajs]?
