# ClojureScript

## Start

https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[thheller/shadow-cljs]
https://github.com/filipesilva/create-cljs-app[filipesilva/create-cljs-app]

```bash
yarn create cljs-app my-app
```

Change `shadow-cljs.edn` to update the dependency. 

Upgrade the JavaScript dependencies.

```bash
yarn upgrade
yarn remove clj-kondo
```

https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/install.md[`clj-kondo`] causes a problems so I remove it.
Install with system package manager instead. Don't use npm. The promblem is caused by https://github.com/avh4/binwrap[`binwrap`] but no idea how to fix this.

Upgrade the ClojureScript dependencies.

```clojure
;; Check the latest version by yourself
;; ...
 :dependencies [[reagent "1.1.1"]
                [devcards "0.2.7"]]
;; ...
```

Check the https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html[Users Guide of shadow-cljs]

```bash
yarn start
```

shadow-cljs will update the dependencies automatically.

```bash
shadow-cljs - HTTP server available at http://localhost:3001
shadow-cljs - server version: 2.18.0 running at http://localhost:9630
shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 3333
shadow-cljs - watching build :app
```

> Error: Reagent.core/render function was moved to reagent.dom namespace in Reagent v1.0.

Change `[reagent.core :as r]` to `[reagent.dom :as r]` in `src/app/core.cljs` 

If you're using React18, you will get the following error. (Just use React17)

> Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot

No idea what the fuck is this. Reagent will https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/f64821ce2234098a837ac7e280969f98ab11342e/ROADMAP.md[fix it someday].

### Vite?

> shadow-cljs can provide additional basic HTTP servers via the `:dev-http`

Seems the web server is powered by https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[`ring`].

No reason to use Vite. shadow-cljs handles everything including packaging. But basically clojure
is playing its own game.
